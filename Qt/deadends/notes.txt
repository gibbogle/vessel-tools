To link to 64-bit ITK libraries, a 64-bit Qt program must be built with cmake in QtCreator.
The CMakeLists.txt file is processed by cmake selecting the MSVC++ 2010 (x64) generator, and 
the release build is selected by setting the parameter:

-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

To ensure that the 64-bit Qt libraries are found the PATH variable must be set.
This is done by executing runQtCreator64.bat first.

Note that for the 32-bit Qt Creator build to work the 32-bit libraries must appear in the PATH
before the 64-bit versions.
