To determine a node number using CMGUI (note the numbering is 1-based)

Open the network in cmgui
On the Command Window, select Graphics >Scene Editor
Click on Vessels in the left panel
In the right panel, under Cylinders, untick 1. cylinders..  Now only 2. node-points is ticked
Click on 2. node-points.. (leave it ticked)
You will observe that now the scene is showing only nodal spheres of different sizes.  We want to display the node numbers.
Go down to Label: (currently showing "-" selected) and select cmiss_number
Note the artistic effect created :)
It is a bit hard to see the numbers unless the spheres are made smaller.  It helps to change Scale factors 
to something small, like 0.1
