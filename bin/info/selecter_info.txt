Selecter information

This program enables creation of a subset of the network.  
The user specifies a range of vessel diameters: (Dmin,Dmax), and the selection criterion:

Average diameter: Vessels which have average diameter in this range are selected
Majority of points: Vessels for which more than half the points have diameter in this range are selected

The resulting network (which is not necessarily connected) is saved to the specified output .am file, and optionally to CMGUI files.
