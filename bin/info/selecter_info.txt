Selecter information
--------------------
This program enables creation of a subset of the network, on the basis of:
segment diameter, segment length, or length/diameter ratio

If diameter is chosen, the user specifies a range of segment diameters: (Dmin, Dmax), 
and the selection criterion:
  Average diameter: Segments with average diameter in this range are selected
  Majority of points: Segments for which more than half the points have diameter in this range are selected
  All points: Segments for which all points have diameter in this range are selected

If length is chosen, the user specifies a range of vessel lengths: (Lmin, Lmax)

If ratio is chosen, the user specifies the threshold ratio, and whether segments with length/diameter < ratio or > ratio are selected

The user can choose to restrict the network to the largest connected subnetwork.

The resulting network is saved to the specified output .am file, and optionally to CMGUI files.
