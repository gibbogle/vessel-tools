Selecter information

This program enables creation of a subset of the network, on the basis of
either vessel diameter or vessel length.  

If diameter is chosen, the user specifies a range of vessel diameters: (Dmin,Dmax), 
and the selection criterion:

Average diameter: Vessels which have average diameter in this range are selected
Majority of points: Vessels for which more than half the points have diameter in this range are selected
All points: Vessels for which all points have diameter in this range are selected

If length is chosen, the user specifies a range of vessel lengths: (Lmin,Lmax)

The user can choose to restrict the network to the largest connected subnetwork.

The resulting network is saved to the specified output .am file, and optionally to CMGUI files.
