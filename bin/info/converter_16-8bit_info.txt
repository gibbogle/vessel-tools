Converter_16-8bit information

This program converts a 16-bit grayscale 3D TIFF image to 8-bit.

Data in the 16-bit file is stored in Nb bits, where Nb <= 16

A 16-bit value val16 is converted to 8-bit thus: val8 = val16*255/vmax16,
where vmax16 = 2^Nb - 1

After conversion, 8-bit values less than the threshold value are set to 0
(this is to clean up the background, if required)
