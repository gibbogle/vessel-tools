Flooder information

Parameters:

maximum # of pixels to be filled = M
maximum gap to be filled = G
# of iterations

2D flood filling is used to fill vessel interiors. In three passes, processing
is carried out on all slices in the XY, YZ and XZ planes.

In each slice, there are optionally one or two processing stages.

Stage 1 (optional)
If G > 0, there is a preliminary closing of small gaps in connected (lit) objects.
This is to handle the cases where the cross-section of a vessel is not quite closed.
Filling the gap to fully enclose the interior ensures that this will be filled in
the next stage.

Stage 2
Totally enclosed "islands" of unlit pixels are detected, and those with a pixel
count < M are lit.
