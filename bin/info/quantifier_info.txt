Quantifier info

This program is used to extract vessel data from the network .am file, for comparison with histology.

Input data:
(1) Amira spatialgraph file.
(2) Close file. This is the file created by the program close.exe.  It is a compressed version of the binary image that corresponds to the tissue volume of the sample image (or the peeled image if peeling was used).
(3) Result file.  Results are logged here.
(4) Voxel dimensions.  
No computations are possible until all input data are supplied.

The user can select the units that will be applied to all inputs, either voxels or distance (um).
Histology calculations will be carried out for a slice selected by axis and cut location on the axis.  
Optionally a rectangular block can be specified, either by the range in each direction or by specifying the centre location and the length of each of the two sides.

There is the option of computing average histology results for a specified 3D block.  In this case the user specifies the range in each of the three axis directions.  Additionally 1, 2 or 3 axis checkboxes are ticked.  For each axis selected, calculations will be carried out on all the slices in the block perpendicular to that axis, and presented in average form for each axis.

The results are shown as: tissue area of the slice, number of pixels in the slice, number of vessels intersecting the slice, density of vessels (count/area), number of vessel pixels, vessel fraction of tissue area.
