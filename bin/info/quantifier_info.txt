Quantifier info

This program is used to extract vessel data from the network .am file,for comparison with histology.

Input data:
(1) Amira spatialgraph file.
(2) Close file. This is the file created by the program close.exe.  It is a compressed version of the binary image that corresponds to the tissue volume of the sample image (or the peeled image if peeling was used).
(3) Result file.  Results are logged here.
(4) Voxel dimensions.  
No computations are possible until all input data are supplied.

The user can select the histology slice by axis and cut location on the axis, which can be specified either by voxel number or by distance (um).  No results will be computed if the supplied slice location is outside the tissue range.

The results are shown as: tissue area of the slice, number of vessels intersecting the slice, density of vessels (count/area).
