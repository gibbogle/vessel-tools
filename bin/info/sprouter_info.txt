Program for investigating sprouts (deadends) in a vessel network.

Input files:
   Amira network file (.am)
   Tiff image file that was used to create the Amira file

Output files:
   Amira network file with just the vessel sprouts
   Tiff image file generated from the Amira sprout network file

The sequence of steps is:
   Supply voxel dimensions (um)
   Supply all file names
   Evaluate network (this reads the input files)
   Detect sprouts
   Evaluate sprouts (intensity computed)
   Save sprout files (Amira network and tiff image files are written)
