Program for investigating dead ends in a vessel network.

Input files:
   Amira network file (.am)
   Tiff image file that was used to create the Amira file

Output files:
   Amira network file with just the dead-end vessels
   Tiff image file generated from the Amira dead-end network file

The sequence of steps is:
   Supply voxel dimensions (um)
   Supply all file names
   Evaluate network (this reads the input files)
   Detect dead ends
   Evaluate dead ends (intensity computed)
   Save dead-end files (Amira network and tiff image files are written)
