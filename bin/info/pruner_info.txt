Program to prune short twigs (sprouts, deadends...)

If pruning is selected, the user must specify the pruning parameters:
    (twig length)/diameter ratio limit - twigs with a ratio less than this value will be pruned
    Number of pruning cycles - the pruning is carried out repeatedly if more than one cyccle is specified

The program generates histograms of vessel diameter and length in the usual way, and the relevant parameters must be provided.

Optionally, CMGUI files are written.

(The capabilities of pruner overlap with those of translater)
