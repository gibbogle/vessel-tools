Program to prune short twigs (sprouts, deadends...) and remove extra-thin vessels

If pruning is selected, the user must specify the pruning parameters: 

    Number of pruning cycles - the pruning is carried out repeatedly if more than one cycle is specified

    If 'Use ratio' is selected, the '(twig length)/diameter' parameter is used as a ratio limit 
      - twigs with a ratio less than this value will be pruned
    else the parameter is treated simply as a limit on twig length, and twigs shorter than this will be pruned.

    If the 'diameter limit' parameter is greater than zero, any vessel (not just a twig) with diameter 
    less than this value will be removed.

The program generates histograms of vessel diameter and length in the usual way, and the relevant parameters 
must be provided.

Optionally, CMGUI files are written.

(The capabilities of pruner overlap with those of translater)
