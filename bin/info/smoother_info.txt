Smoother information

The purpose of creating a smoothed image is to use it as the background in
the local thresholding step.

The input parameter, R, is nominally the radius over which averaging is
done, but in fact the averaging region is a cube NxNxN, where N = 2R+1.

The value computed at the centre of the cube is the sum of values at the voxels
within the cube divided by NxNxN.

Execution is significantly speeded up by using multiple CPUs.
