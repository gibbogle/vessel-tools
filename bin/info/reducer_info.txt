Reducer information

This program creates modified version of the network, in which some very short vessels are eliminated by merging two junctions into one.
The criterion for vessel elimination is: length/diameter < specified threshold value.

For the computation of network statistics (averages and distributions of diameter and length) there are two options for limiting the influence of short vessels.

Option 1. If the specified length limit is negative, the same length/diameter criterion used to remove short vessels will be used in the statistics calculation.  This has the effect of ignoring short vessels that could not be eliminated.

Option 2. If it is positive, the specified length limit will be used to ignore short vessels.

The resulting network is saved to the specified output .am file, and optionally to CMGUI files.
