Denoiser information

This program removes background noise from a binary 3D TIFF image.

Using BinaryMedianImageFilter, it computes the value of each output voxel as the statistical median of the neighbourhood of values around the corresponding input voxel.

Radius specifies the size of the neighbourhood along each dimension. The value is used as the semi-size of a cubic box. 
For example, a radius of 1 will result in a 3x3x3 neighbourhood, while a radius of 2 will result in a 5x5x5 neighbourhood.
