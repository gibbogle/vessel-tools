Am_cutter information

This program enables a network (SpatialGraph) to be cut into 2, 4 or 8 blocks.
Cuts are made at the specified locations on the X, Y and Z axes.
If a cut value of 0 is specified, no cut is made on that axis.

The cut values are in terms of the units of the .am file, i.e. um.

All vessel segments with a vertex that falls within the block are selected for that block (note that this implies that a vessel may be put in two blocks).
The resulting networks (which are not necessarily connected) are saved to .am files, with names prefixed by the specified base name.
E.g. if the base name is BLK, the files are BLK_x1_y1_z1.am, BLK_x2_y1_z1.am, BLK_x1_y2_z1.am ...
