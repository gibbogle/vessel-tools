Translater information

This program translates an Amira spatialgraph file (.am) to a pair of CMGUI files, 
and computes the distributions of vessel diameter and vessel length.

The CMGUI files are generated if the box is ticked.

The Amira file is written out using a more concise format, as zzz.am.
