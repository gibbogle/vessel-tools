Translater information

This program translates an Amira spatialgraph file (.am) to a pair of CMGUI files, 
and computes the statistics of vessel diameter and vessel length.

In computing statistics, there are three options concerning treatment of very short vessels:
Option 1: all vessels are included
Option 2: vessels less than the specified length limit are excluded
Option 3: vessels with length/diameter less than the specified limit are excluded

The widths of the boxes used for counting vessels to compute the probability distributions must be specified.

The CMGUI files are generated if the box is ticked.

The Amira file is written out using a more concise format, as zzz.am.

Importing distribution data into Excel:

Copy and paste block of data (including header line) into the spreadsheet

Data > Text to columns

Delimited

Tick "Space" and "Treat consecutive delimiters as one", for "Text qualifier" select '
