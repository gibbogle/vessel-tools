Batcher information
-----------------------
This program executes conduit_analyse on a set of subregions of a network stored in Amira Spatialgraph format (.am file).

Site info (name, centre (x0,y0,z0), size (R)) can be entered into the table manually, or read from a text file.  (This is to save you having to re-enter the data every time the program is run.)
The file uses comma-separated fields (so the site name must not have any spaces), one line for each site:

Site_abc 100 200 300 100
Site_def 200 300 400 100
Site_ghi 300 200 100 50
....

The following parameters control the Cm estimation, for each selected site:

Starting sphere centre and radius.  Cell paths have starting points within a sphere defined by the centre and radius.

Average speed.  This is the average speed with which cells move along fibres.  
A speed is assigned to each path as a random variate drawn from a Gaussian distribution with this mean and with standard deviation = 1/10 of this value.

Cosine power.  At a fibre junction probabilities are assigned to the various exit fibres.  The probability of taking a particular fibre is proportional to cos(theta)^n where theta is the turning angle and n = cosine power.

Number of trials.  This is the number of cell paths that are generated.  The distance d from the starting point is calculated after one hour.  Cm = (1/6)*(average d^2).

In computing network statistics, there are three options concerning treatment of very short vessels:
Option 1: all vessels are included
Option 2: vessels less than the specified length limit are excluded
Option 3: vessels with length/diameter less than the specified limit are excluded

The widths of the boxes used for counting vessels to compute the probability distributions must be specified.

Optionally the distribution of distance to the nearest conduit can be computed for each spherical subregion.  In this case tiff images of the remote regions (further than the specified threshold distance from the nearest conduit) can be generated.
