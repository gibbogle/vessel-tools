Batcher information
-----------------------
This program executes conduit_analyse on a set of subregions of a network stored in Amira Spatialgraph format (.am file).

Site info (name, centre (x0,y0,z0), size (R)) can be entered into the table manually, or read from a file.

The following parameters control the Cm estimation, for each selected site:

Starting sphere centre and radius.  Cell paths have starting points within a sphere defined by the centre and radius.

Average speed.  This is the average speed with which cells move along fibres.  
A speed is assigned to each path as a random variate drawn from a Gaussian distribution with this mean and with standard deviation = 1/10 of this value.

Cosine power.  At a fibre junction probabilities are assigned to the various exit fibres.  The probability of taking a particular fibre is proportional to cos(theta)^n where theta is the turning angle and n = cosine power.

Number of trials.  This is the number of cell paths that are generated.  The distance d from the starting point is calculated after one hour.  Cm = (1/6)*(average d^2).

In computing network statistics, there are three options concerning treatment of very short vessels:
Option 1: all vessels are included
Option 2: vessels less than the specified length limit are excluded
Option 3: vessels with length/diameter less than the specified limit are excluded

The widths of the boxes used for counting vessels to compute the probability distributions must be specified.
