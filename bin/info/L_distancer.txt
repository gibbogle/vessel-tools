L_distancer generates a probability distribution of the distance from points along the centreline of the vascular network to the nearest lymphatic boundary.

The program proceeds by two stages.  

Stage 1. The binary tiff image of the lymphatics is processed to generate a text file containing the locations of all the boundary voxels.

Stage 2. The information in the network file is combined with the lymphatic boundary data previously generated to compute the distribution of distance.

Files:

Vascular network file (.am)
Lymphatic binary image (.tif)
Output distribution file (.out)
Boundary data file (.dat) (Note that either this is created or an existing file is used)

Voxel dimensions (um) must be provided.

Note that the option of defining a spherical subregion is currently not implemented.
