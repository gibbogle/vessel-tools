Zoomer information

This program enables selection of a subset of the network.  
The user specifies a subregion by:
  the centre (xv,yv,zv)
and 
  the size wv
  (i.e. the diameter if a sphere is chosen, or the width for a cube).  
These values are all in terms of the voxel coordinates of the original 3D image.
The voxel size is used to translate the values into the units the network file uses, i.e. um:
xc = voxelsize*xv
yc = voxelsize*yv
zc = voxelsize*zv
wc = voxelsize*wv

All vessel segments with a vertex that falls within the subregion are selected.
The resulting network (which is not necessarily connected) is saved to the specified output .am file, and optionally to CMGUI files.

If "Shift origin" is selected, the origin of the network will be shifted to be consistent with the corresponding cropped TIFF file.  
If the centre is (xc,yc,zc) and R = (cube width)/2:
x -> x - (xc-R)
y -> y - (yc-R)
z -> z - (zc-R)
where xc, yc, zc, R are the values after scaling by voxelsize.
