Vdistancer generates a probability distribution for the distance from the nearest blood vessel.

The analysis can be either for the whole network, or for a spherical subregion.

Parameters:

(Note that all distances are in microns)

Grid spacing (grid_dx).  This is the spacing of the regular 3D grid of points where the distance is computed.  
Note that a value that is too small will cause the program to exceed available memory and fail. 
For the whole network a value in the range 3 - 5 um is usually appropriate.  For a subregion a smaller value can be used.

Grid number fraction (pt_fraction).  This sets the fraction of the total grid from which interior points will be randomly selected.
The size of the grid is determined by grid_dx.  Note that some fraction of these grid points will lie outside the tissue.
Choosing a large value of pt_fraction will result in a long execution time, but more dense points.
Very dense points are not needed for computing the vessel distance distribution (this is readily checked by comparing the distributions generated with different values of pt_fraction) but the hypoxic region image is improved by higher density of points.
 
If the sphere subregion option is selected:

(x0,y0,z0) is the centre of the sphere with the specified radius.  In this case all grid points within the sphere are used.

If Image hypoxic regions is selected, a tiff file is created.  Points greater than the specified distance from the nearest vessel will generate lit voxels.
The voxel size will equal the specified grid size (um).
