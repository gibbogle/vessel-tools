Vdistancer generates a probability distribution for the distance from a blood vessel.

The analysis can be either for the whole network, or for a spherical subregion.

Parameters:

(Note that all distances are in microns)

Grid spacing (grid_dx).  This is the spacing of the regular 3D grid of points where the distance is computed.  
Note that a value that is too small will cause the program to exceed available memory and fail. 
For the whole network a value in the range 3 - 5 um is usually appropriate.  For a subregion a smaller value can be used.

 
If the sphere subregion option is selected:

(x0,y0,z0) is the centre of the sphere with the specified radius.
