Vdistancer generates a probability distribution for the distance from the nearest blood vessel.

The analysis can be either for the whole network, or for a spherical subregion.

Input files:

1. Network file (.am)
2. Close file (.bin)  The close (or hull) file is used to define the tissue region.
   NOTE: This is not a tiff file!  It is a special binary format that effectively compresses the tiff data (the data uses less memory than the image when loaded).  DO NOT USE THE CORRESPONDING .tif FILE
3. Output file (.out)  This is a simple text file to hold the generated distribution.

Parameters:

(Note that all distances are in microns)

Grid spacing (grid_dx).  This is the spacing of the regular 3D grid of points where the distance is computed.  
Note that a value that is too small will cause the program to exceed available memory and fail. 
For the whole network a value in the range 3 - 5 um is usually appropriate.  For a subregion a smaller value can be used.

If the sphere subregion option is selected:

(x0,y0,z0) is the centre of the sphere with the specified radius.  In this case all grid points within the sphere are used.

If Image hypoxic regions is selected, a tiff file is created.  Points greater than the specified distance from the nearest vessel will generate lit voxels.
The voxel size will equal the specified grid size (um).
