Thinner information

The code operates on a thresholded, connected object image.
The thinning code is based on the ITK filter, itkBinaryThinningImageFilter3D.
Modifications have been made to speed it up, but the functionality is unchanged.
Voxels are removed until a skeleton of single connected voxels remains.
