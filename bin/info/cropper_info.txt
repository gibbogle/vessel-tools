Cropper information

This program enables selection and saving of a subregion of a 3D TIFF image, either a block or a sphere. 
If a rectangular block:
  The user specifies a subregion either by:
    the X, Y and Z ranges
  or by
    the centre and size for each axis (size is the voxel range)
If a sphere, the user specifies centre and radius.

(all values are in voxel units)

For comparison with a sub-network generated with zoomer, the piece should be a cube, i.e. all sizes should be the same.  
It is advisable to make the size an odd number to ensure that the centre point is exactly the centre of the cube.
Note that the centre and range numbers are 0-based for consistency with Amira network coordinates (unlike Irfanview, which uses 1-based pixel coordinates).
When loaded into Amira for comparison with the zoomed network, the voxelsize must be specified in order to ensure that the two representations are aligned.
