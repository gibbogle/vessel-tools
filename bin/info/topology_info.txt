Topology information

Parameters:
voxelsize = size of voxel in um
diameter  = vessel diameter when a fixed diameter is specified

Data from the thresholded, connected object image is combined with data from the skeleton image in order to quantify the network.

The length of each vessel segment is computed (distance along the vessel between junctions), and the distribution (histogram) of lengths is output.

The average vessel diameter is estimated at each skeleton voxel.
Two probability distributions of vessel diameter are output, one based simply on the number of vessels, the other weighted by vessel length.  This second distribution is more meaningful.

The total volume of the vessel network is computed, together with the volume corresponding to the number of lit voxels in the segmented image.
The calibration parameter allows a small adjustment to be made to the estimated diameters.  By appropriate choice of this parameter the total vessel volume can be made consistent with the volume based on the lit voxel count.

If "Uniform vessel diameters?" is checked, for each vessel the average diameter is computed and applied to all interior points.  This is done in a way that conserves vessel volume.

All results are in units of micrometres (um).

If "Fixed diameter" is checked and a diameter value is specified, the network files are generated using this diameter for all vessels.  This aids viewing the network topology.

At a junction point the diameter is set either to the maximum diameter of the connected vessel segments, or to the average.  If the average option is selected, a threshold value of the ratio of max diam to min diam must be specified.  When the ratio at the junction exceeds this threshold the max diameter is used.  A large threshold value will ensure that the average is always used.

The program always carries out one pruning, and extra pruning cycles may be applied. The pruning parameter is always 5 - twigs with length/(average diameter) < 5 are pruned.
