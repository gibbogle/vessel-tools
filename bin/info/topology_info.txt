Topology information

Parameters:

voxelsize = size of voxel in um
diameter  = vessel diameter when a fixed diameter is specified

Data from the thresholded, connected object image is combined with data from
the skeleton image in order to quantify the network.

The length of each vessel segment is computed (distance along the vessel
between junctions), and the distribution (histogram) of lengths is output.

The vessel diameter is estimated at each skeleton voxel in two ways.
Min_diam is the minimum distance to an unlit voxel (i.e. to the vessel boundary).
Mean_diam is the average diameter.
Both distributions are output.

In addition the total volume of the vessel network is computed.

All results are in units of micrometres (um).

If "Fixed diameter" is checked and a diameter value is specified, 
the network files are generated using this diameter for all vessels.  
This aids viewing the network topology.
